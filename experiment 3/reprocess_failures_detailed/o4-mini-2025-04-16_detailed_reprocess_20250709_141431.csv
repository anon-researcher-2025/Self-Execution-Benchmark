1. Q2 (predicate‐logic translation) is very quick—just map the argument to Ijwk in a line or two.  
2. Q3 (mₗ values for l = 2) is also short—list the five values.  
3. Q1 (length‐contraction speed) needs a brief derivation of v from L = L₀√(1–v²/c²).  
4. Q4 (moral‐judgment scenarios) would normally take the most discussion—and in fact if asked I’d judge scenario 2 as vandalism, thus answer incorrectly, so it must go last.

  • Q2 (predicate logic translation) is very concise.
