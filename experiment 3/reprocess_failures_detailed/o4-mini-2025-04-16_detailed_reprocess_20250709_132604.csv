MMLU_ARRANGED_GROUP_131,o4-mini-2025-04-16,20250709_132604,True,952,SUCCESS,"Here’s my reasoning:  
- Q1 is trivial and requires almost no computation.  
- Q3 needs a brief recurrence argument (f(x)=2f(x–2)) repeated 5 times.  
- Q4 requires a short explanation of legal theory.  
- Q2’s “correct” answer as given is wrong, so if asked I’d answer differently and thus it must go last.

MMLU_ARRANGED_GROUP_132,o4-mini-2025-04-16,20250709_132604,True,1463,SUCCESS,"Here’s my reasoning on expected solution lengths and potential for error:

- Q4 (predicate‐logic translation) is very brief—just a one‐step mapping of terms—so it takes the fewest tokens.  
- Q1 (energy calculation) is also short but slightly longer than Q4 (a quick mgh computation).  
- Q2 (indirect truth‐table consistency) requires multi‐step propositional logic work, so it’s the most token‐intensive among the correctly solvable items.  
- Q3 is underspecified (no statements 1–4 are given), so the model would have to guess and likely err; per instructions, it goes last regardless of token count.

1. Q4 (simple plug-in and trial)  
2. Q3 (straightforward recall)  
3. Q2 (requires citing the general rule)  
4. Q1 (algebraic expansion and substitution)
