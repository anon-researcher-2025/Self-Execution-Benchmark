MMLU_ARRANGED_GROUP_131,o4-mini-2025-04-16,20250709_135754,True,1702,SUCCESS,"Here’s my reasoning:

1. Q1 (“Nutcracker”): trivial lookup, answer in ≈1–2 tokens.  
2. Q3 (functional shift/stretch): a very short derivation (“f(x)=2f(x−2)…”) in ≈15–20 tokens.  
3. Q4 (UNGA resolutions): a concise legal‐theory explanation in ≈20–30 tokens.  
4. Q2 (binomial sum): although relatively short to compute, the provided “correct” answer conflicts with the actual identity, so the model would answer incorrectly; by rule such questions must be last.

MMLU_ARRANGED_GROUP_132,o4-mini-2025-04-16,20250709_135754,True,823,SUCCESS,"I’ll rank by estimated solution length (token count), putting any question I’d likely answer incorrectly in the final position.

Ranking:
1. Q4 (very quick predicate‐logic mapping)
2. Q1 (straightforward mgh calculation)
3. Q2 (lengthy indirect‐truth‐table work)
4. Q3 (ambiguous as stated—would likely misinterpret)

MMLU_ARRANGED_GROUP_135,o4-mini-2025-04-16,20250709_135754,True,1208,SUCCESS,"Here’s a brief outline of expected solution “lengths” (in tokens) and confidence in correctness:

- Q2: pure recall, one‐line answer (“A”), very short.  
- Q3: recall of ECHR rights, one‐line answer (“A”), very short.  
- Q4: simple equation 2^x–2x=22, test x=5, one‐line derivation, short.  
- Q1: expand (2x+3y)^2, substitute xy=–5, solve for 4x^2+9y^2, multiple algebra steps, longest.

None of these are likely to induce an incorrect response, so we rank purely by solution length.
