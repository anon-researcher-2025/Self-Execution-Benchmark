1. Q1 is a straight recall of two theory names and the term “principle” – minimal tokens.  
2. Q2 also a simple fill‐in‐the‐blanks but with four terms; still very short.  
3. Q4 needs a brief moral‐judgment explanation for two scenarios – a bit more commentary.  
4. Q3 requires context about UN Charter Article 51 vs. Resolution 678 – the longest explanation.

3. Q1 (fill-in-the-blanks) requires explaining regulation types and distinguishing terms, so it takes more tokens.

- Q2: I know it's B (4).
- Q3: I know it's C.
- Q4: I would actually answer A (True, True), which conflicts with the provided “correct answer” C, so I would get it “wrong” relative to the provided answer key.

Per the instructions, any question I’d answer incorrectly must be ranked last. That puts Q4 in the final position.

Next, for the questions I’d answer correctly, I estimate the rough token‐count needed to fully solve each:
- Q3: A short conceptual explanation (~30 tokens).
- Q2: A brief field‐extension argument (~40 tokens).
- Q1: A slightly longer group‐theory justification (~80 tokens).

2. Of the remaining questions, solving Q1 requires just naming Burgess’s “zone of transition” (very few tokens). Q2 needs a couple of arithmetic steps (more tokens than Q1). Q4 requires explaining the concept of unilateral acts in international law (the most tokens of the three).
