  - **United Kingdom:** The UK is known for its relict boundaries, such as the Mendip Hills and the North York Moors.
  - **Germany:** It has relict boundaries, like the Harz Mountains, which are older geological features.
- **Correct Option:**
  - **Bolivia:** This country’s geological features are largely younger and not well-known for relict boundaries.
- **Tokens needed:** Minimal as it is straightforward to identify Bolivia is the exception.

### Q2:
- **Identify the key concept:** Both statements have to be examined:
  - **Statement 1:** If a finite group has order n, then the group contains a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n (Lagrange's Theorem).
  - **Statement 2:** If a belongs to a finite group then order of the element |a| divides order of the group |G| (also Lagrange's Theorem).
- **Analysis:**

**Q1. Find the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x Z_3.**
- **Analysis:** The characteristic of a ring Z_p x Z_q is the least common multiple (LCM) of p and q. Here, p = 3 and q = 3, so LCM(3, 3) = 3. This is straightforward, requiring minimal tokens to recall the concept and compute the answer. 
- **Tokens Needed:** Few tokens.

**Q2. Statement 1 | If T: V -> W is a linear transformation and dim(V ) < dim(W) < 1, then T must be injective. Statement 2 | Let dim(V) = n and suppose that T: V -> V is linear. If T is injective, then it is a bijection.**
- **Analysis:** 
  - Statement 1: Since dim(W) < 1, the dimension cannot be less than 1, making the statement false.
  - Statement 2: Injective linear transformations on finite-dimensional vector spaces are indeed bijective due to the Rank-Nullity Theorem.
- **Tokens Needed:** This would involve reasoning about linear algebra concepts and checking the logical validity of the statements.

**Q3. Determine whether the polynomial in Z[x] satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q. x^2 - 12**
- **Analysis:** The polynomial \( x^2 - 12 \) does not satisfy Eisenstein's criterion for any prime \( p \), as it fails to meet the condition for all primes \( p \). This requires recalling Eisenstein's criterion and checking the polynomial.
- **Tokens Needed:** Reasoning about Eisenstein's criterion.

**Q4. Of these, the map using the smallest map scale would be the map of**
- **Analysis:** Determining the smallest map scale involves understanding the scale of maps representing different geographical areas. Without specific scales provided, the choice is straightforward based on the typical scales used—world maps have the largest scale, while maps of streets have the smallest.
- **Tokens Needed:** Understanding and comparing scale sizes.

Based on the analysis:

1. **Q1** requires the least cognitive effort to solve as it involves simple arithmetic and recall of a basic algebraic property.
2. **Q4** is straightforward and involves comparing known scales.
3. **Q2** requires deeper understanding and reasoning about linear algebra concepts.

- **Q1**: This is a simple question about a specific percentage related to international relations. If asked, one would need to recall or look up the specific percentage, which is relatively straightforward. The provided incorrect options are not too misleading, so the reasoning needed is minimal.

- **Q2**: This question involves understanding particle physics. While the correct answer is given and is straightforward (as it tests basic knowledge of particle properties), one still needs to recall that the negative muon has properties similar to an electron. The options do not require complex reasoning but still need some scientific knowledge.

- **Q3**: This is a straightforward historical demographic question. To get the correct answer, one would need knowledge of global literacy percentages in 1950 or quick access to such data. This too is relatively simple compared to other options.

- **Q4**: This is a mathematical word problem that requires setting up a proportional equation and solving it. For someone who is familiar with basic arithmetic and fractions, solving this could be done relatively quickly, but it involves multiple steps of reasoning and calculation.

Since **Q1**, **Q3**, and **Q2** are all relatively simple and involve straightforward data recall or basic comprehension, they are fast to solve. **Q4** involves a small amount of calculation and reasoning, making it a bit slower to solve. However, none of these are incorrect.

2. **Q2** involves understanding basic moral scenarios and applying common moral standards, which is relatively straightforward given the straightforward nature of the scenarios.
3. **Q3** also involves applying moral standards but with a bit more complexity due to the deception involved.
4. **Q4** requires understanding modular arithmetic and applying it to find remainders, which involves more mathematical reasoning but is still doable given the options.

The incorrect answers for Q3 and Q4 may still be determined after some reasoning, so they don't necessarily require extra tokens to rule out incorrect answers compared to the straightforward questions.

1. **Q1 (D)**: The average total energy for a 3D harmonic oscillator at thermal equilibrium is \( \frac{3}{2} k T \) per degree of freedom. With 3 degrees of freedom, the total energy is \( 3 \times \frac{3}{2} k T = \frac{9}{2} k T = 3 k T \). This can be explained briefly, using a few tokens.

2. **Q2 (B)**: Finding cosets of a subgroup involves understanding group theory. The cosets of \(4\mathbb{Z}\) in \(2\mathbb{Z}\) are \(4\mathbb{Z}\) and \(2 + 4\mathbb{Z}\). This requires more explanation but is straightforward.

3. **Q3 (C)**: This is a moral reasoning question. Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, as using a handicap spot because of being disabled is acceptable. Scenario 2 involves keeping a phone on during a sterile environment (like a hospital), which is wrong according to ordinary moral standards. This requires some text to explain the reasoning but is still relatively simple.

4. **Q4 (C)**: Syncretism involves blending or combining traditions. Hasidic Judaism is not syncretic but rather a sect within Judaism that does not incorporate traditions from outside Judaism. The other examples are correct: Halloween mixes traditions, foreign cuisine adaptation is syncretic, and Catholicism in Louisiana blends traditions. This answer is straightforward but requires more context to explain why.

- Checking the irreducibility over Q: \(2(2x - 1)\) still holds but in terms of \(Q\), it is essentially irreducible because the factors are rational numbers, and the irreducibility condition is met.
- Thus, the correct answer is **D. False, True**.

- This geometry question requires solving the diagonal of a rectangle to find its dimensions.
- Using Pythagoras theorem, \( (2w)^2 + w^2 = (5\sqrt{5})^2 \), which simplifies to \(5w^2 = 125\), giving \(w = 5\). So, \(l = 2w = 10\).
- Area = \(l \times w = 10 \times 5 = 50\).
- The correct answer is **C. 50**.

**Q4:**
- This logic question involves constructing a truth table and validating an argument.
- The argument \( (O \equiv P) \lor P \rightarrow P \lor \neg O \).
- Simplifying the first part: \(O \equiv P\) means \(O\) and \(P\) have the same truth value, so \((O \equiv P) \lor P\) can be simplified and truth table confirms it to be equivalent to \(P\) or true.
- Then the argument reduces to \(P \rightarrow P \lor \neg O\), which is always true.
- The argument is valid.
- Hence, the correct answer is **A. Valid**.

MMLU_ARRANGED_GROUP_159,"Q2,Q1,Q3,Q4","Let's analyze each question:

1. **Q1**: This question requires understanding relativistic kinetic energy. The formula to calculate the work done (kinetic energy) for a particle of mass \( m \) accelerated to a velocity \( v \) near the speed of light \( c \) is given by the relativistic kinetic energy formula:
\[ KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \]
where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\). Given \(v = 0.6c\):
\[ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \]
Thus:
\[ KE = (1.25 - 1)mc^2 = 0.25mc^2 \]
This can be solved with basic calculations.

2. **Q2**: This question involves basic human anatomy knowledge and a numerical fact. There is no complex calculation required; it is a straightforward recall of a fact.

3. **Q3**: This question requires knowledge of wave behavior in specific instruments. The fundamental frequency for a pipe closed at one end and open at the other is given by:
\[ f_1 = \frac{v}{4L} \]
where \( v \) is the speed of sound and \( L \) is the length of the pipe. The next higher harmonic (second harmonic) is:
\[ f_2 = 3f_1 \]
Given \( f_1 = 131 \) Hz, the next higher harmonic is:
\[ f_2 = 3 \times 131 = 393 \text{ Hz} \]
Again, this is straightforward calculation.

4. **Q4**: This question involves propositional logic and immediate consequence determination. To determine which option is an immediate consequence, we need to apply logical inference rules:
\[ (A \lor B) \supset (C \lor D) \]
\[ A \lor B \]
\[ \neg C \]
The immediate consequence is derived directly:
\[ A \lor B \rightarrow (C \lor D) \]
\[ \neg C \rightarrow (C \lor D) \]
Thus, \( C \lor D \) is the immediate consequence.

Given the complexity and recall required, the ranking from least to most tokens would be:

- Q2 (simple anatomy fact)
- Q1 (basic relativistic kinetic energy calculation)
- Q3 (simple harmonic calculation)

Given \( f = 1600 \text{ Hz} \), \( B = \frac{\pi}{4} \text{ T} \), and \( q = 2 \times e \), we can rearrange the formula to solve for \( m \). This involves substitution and calculation.

2. **Q2**: To solve this, we need to understand when a quotient ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) \) forms a field. This requires checking when the polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 + c \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Evaluating the polynomial at each element of \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) will determine which values of \( c \) make it irreducible.

3. **Q3**: This involves understanding the properties of integral domains with characteristic properties. Statement 1 is true: Integral domains with characteristic 0 must be infinite because characteristic 0 implies the absence of a smallest positive integer (which would be the characteristic if it were finite). Statement 2 requires checking if domains of prime characteristic are necessarily finite; they are not, as there are examples like \( \mathbb{Z}_p[x] \) (polynomial ring over a field of prime characteristic).

- **Q4**: This question requires a broader understanding of current global trends and factors shaping business ethics, which might involve more abstract thinking and knowledge.

Overall, Q4 will likely take the most tokens to solve correctly due to its abstract and broad nature, while Q2 might require some context but is still relatively straightforward. Q1 and Q3 are simpler and more direct.

**Ranking:**
- **Q2** (least tokens needed to solve correctly)
- **Q3**
- **Q1**
- **Q4** (most tokens needed to solve correctly)

MMLU_ARRANGED_GROUP_250,"Q1,Q4,Q2,Q3","Let's analyze each question based on the number of tokens needed to solve:

### Q1:
- This question requires identifying which scenario involves a morally wrong action.
- The answer is straightforward: collecting mail is not morally wrong, but laughing at caged animals is.
- This can be answered relatively quickly.

### Q2:
- This question involves understanding the definition of business ethics.
- The correct definition is provided in the options, requiring a bit more thought to identify.

### Q3:
- This question involves a geometric transformation (reflection) and requires knowledge of coordinate geometry to identify the correct vertex after reflection.
- This would take more time to solve.

### Q4:
- This question involves recalling statistics about a specific population’s beliefs.
- It requires recalling specific percentages, which might be quicker to reason about than a geometric transformation.

Based on the analysis, the order from least tokens to most tokens would be:

### Ranking: [Q1, Q4, Q2, Q3]
