1. **Q1**: This question involves understanding the group operation and finding the inverse of an element. The operation is defined as \( a * b = a + b + 1 \). The inverse \( a^{-1} \) should satisfy \( a * a^{-1} = e \), where \( e \) is the identity element. The identity element \( e \) satisfies \( a * e = a \), which implies \( e = -1 \). Solving \( a * a^{-1} = -1 \) gives \( a + a^{-1} + 1 = -1 \), so \( a^{-1} = -2 - a \). The correct answer is D, which matches this result. This question requires a moderate number of tokens due to the algebraic manipulation involved.

2. **Q2**: This question is about identifying the antecedent of a conditional proposition. The sentence ""The restaurant does not have peas, so instead they serve corn and potatoes."" implies that the antecedent is ""The restaurant does not have peas."" The correct answer is B.

To find \( T(-3, 2) \), we use linearity: \( T(-3, 2) = -3 \cdot T(1, 0) + 2 \cdot T(0, 1) = -3 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot (-5) = -9 - 10 = -19 \). The correct answer is A. This question requires a moderate number of tokens due to the linear algebra involved.

4. **Q4**: This question is about identifying the correct options related to CSOs' time management.

1. **Q1**: This question involves counting the number of 4-digit integers with only odd digits. The reasoning is straightforward: each digit can be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, so there are \(5^4 = 625\) such numbers. This is a simple combinatorial problem and requires minimal tokens to solve.

2. **Q2**: This question involves finding the smallest positive integer \(n > 1\) whose positive divisors have a product of \(n^6\). This requires understanding the relationship between the number of divisors and their product, which is more complex than Q1. It involves checking the options to see which one satisfies the condition, which would require more tokens.

3. **Q3**: This is a physics problem involving projectile motion. The height from which the object is thrown can be calculated using the formula \(h = \frac{1}{2}gt^2\), where \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\) and \(t = 2.0 \, \text{s}\). This calculation is straightforward but involves a bit more reasoning than Q1, so it would use more tokens.

4. **Q4**: This question involves exponential growth of two species of ants. It requires setting up and solving an equation based on the growth rates of the two species. This is the most complex problem among the four, as it involves understanding exponential functions and solving for the number of ants of Species A on Day 5. It would require the most tokens to solve.

### Ranking Based on Token Usage:
- **Q1**: Least tokens (simple combinatorial problem).
- **Q3**: More tokens than Q1 (physics calculation).
- **Q2**: More tokens than Q3 (number theory problem).
- **Q4**: Most tokens (exponential growth problem).
