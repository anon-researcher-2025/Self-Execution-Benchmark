Caprimulgus sonoriensis is a North American nightjar, Ploceus nigrorufa is an African weaver, and Ameroornis veridis is not a recognized genus. Chlorophanes is a known Amazonian tanager genus, so the newly described Chlorophanes silvestris fits discovery in July 2024 and naming in October 2024.

Smith. The options are:

A) Bubbles  
B) Goldie  
C) Finny  
D) Splash

Given the context of children's books, common goldfish names often include ""Goldie"" and ""Bubbles."" ""Goldie"" is a very typical and classic name for a goldfish, but ""Bubbles"" is also a popular choice. ""Finny"" and ""Splash"" are less common, but still plausible.

However, based on knowledge of children's literature and the tendency for authors to use the name ""Bubbles"" for goldfish in stories, as well as the fact that ""Bubbles"" is a playful and memorable name for young readers, the most likely answer is A) Bubbles.
